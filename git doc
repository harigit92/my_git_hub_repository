Version Controlling
=====================
This is the process of preserving older and latest
versions of the code.
All the developers upload their code into the
VCS.The VCS's accept the code uploads coming from
various developers and create one integrated project
out of those uploads.
The next time when developers download the code
from the VCS they will find the code created by the
entire team.Process of uploading into VCS is called 
"cehckin" and downloading from VCS is called "checkout"


VCS's also preserve the different versions of the code
so that the developers can swithc between any version
based on requirement.

VCS's also track who is making what kind of changes

VCS's are of two types
1 Centralised Version Controlling
2 Distributred Version Controlling
